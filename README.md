# PolarSVGedit

A very fast and simple online-SVG-Editor to do the basics with the mouse and all details in code.

After just a little practice PolarSVGedit has a very snappy workflow when used in combination with the mouse and the keybord and generates very clean and minimalistic SVG-Code.

It is designed to be used live i.e. in your lectures drawing creating nice and clean svg-graphics.

When more complex drawings are needed enjoy the clean svg-code and unleash the power of svg by editing the live-rendered code. Add your custom symbols, animations, JavaScript or whatever you need!

## What is this?

PolarSVGedit is a one-file pure-java-script editor for SVG vector images.

You can easily create basic objects like paths or ellipses with the mouse. That way you don't need to do the necessary calculations by hand.

A configurable grid is offered so it is very quick easy to get a good scetch.

The SVG-Code is shown live in a textarea in which you can edit it right away. On every edit with a valid result you get the live-view of your SVG-Image.

## Who should use this?

PolarSVGedit is a good editor for __simple, but very quick and easy drawings__. With a tiny little bit of practise the key-selection of the tools and mouse-selection of the coordinates will let you create __clean SVG-scetches as _fast_ as you would draw it on paper or a board!__

For the edits with the gui you will get __clean and good readable SVG-code__ with relative coordinates when possible.
That way it is also a good tool to __learn to code you own SVG__!

But there are limited options in the gui, so for any more complex graphics enjoy unleashing the entire power of SVG by __coding clean SVG youself with a live-view of you code-edits__ - way beyond most gui-editors!

Since PolerSVGedit is a single-file pure-java-script application you can download the html-file and use it offline or __integrate it in you own browser-based application__. The roughly 1000 lines of code should be easy to be copied and adapted to your custom needs.
