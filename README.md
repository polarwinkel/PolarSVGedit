## What is this?

PolarSVGedit is a one-file pure-java-script editor for SVG vector images.

You can easily create basic objects like paths or ellipses with the mouse. That way you don't need to do the necessary calculations by hand.

A configurable grid is offered so it is very quick easy to get a good scetch.

The SVG-Code is shown live in a textarea in which you can edit it right away. On every edit with a valid result you get the live-view of your SVG-Image.

## Who should use this?

PolarSVGedit is a good editor for simple, but very quick and easy scetches.

For the edits with the very limited graphical user interface (gui) you will get clean and good readable SVG-code with relative coordinates when possible.

That way it is also a good tool to learn to code you own SVG!

But there are very limited options in the gui, so for any more complex graphics enjoy unleashing the entire power of SVG by coding clean SVG youself - way beyond most gui-editors!
